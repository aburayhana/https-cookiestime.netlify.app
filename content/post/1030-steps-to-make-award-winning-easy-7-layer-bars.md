I like to keep the ingredients on hand for a lazy Sunday or rainy afternoon, just to whip up. Place it in the oven until melted completely. In a large bowl, beat butter and brown sugar at high speed with an electric mixer until creamy, stopping occasionally to scrape sides of bowl.

In a large bowl, beat butter and brown sugar at high speed with an electric mixer until creamy, stopping occasionally to scrape sides of bowl. You combine graham cracker cookie crumbs with melted butter then pour it into a baking pan. Eagle brand sweetened condensed milk goes on top of that crust, followed by generous layers of chocolate chips and flaked coconut. These are so good and so very easy! I guess mine were six layer bars as I didn&#39;t put the nuts on (but I did add more chips.) I sprayed my glass pan with a bit of Pam spray before putting in the cracker crumbs and after cooling I had no problems removing from the pan.
