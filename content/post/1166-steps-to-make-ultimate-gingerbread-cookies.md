Hello everybody, it's Louise, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, gingerbread cookies. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Gingerbread cookies is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods on earth. It is simple, it's fast, it tastes yummy. It's enjoyed by millions every day. They are nice and they look wonderful. Gingerbread cookies is something that I have loved my whole life.

Gingerbread Cookie Mix layered in a one quart canning jar. Place a circle of gingerbread fabric between lid and ring and tie a gingerbread man cookie cutter onto jar with ribbon! Sift the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, cloves, salt and pepper through a wire sieve into. Cut out cookies with desired cutter-- the ginger bread man is our favorite of course.

##### The ingredients needed to make Gingerbread cookies:

1. Make ready 125 grams unsalted butter slightly melted
1. Prepare 300 grams all-purpose flour
1. Take 1 tbsp honey
1. Take 120 grams white sugar
1. Prepare 1 large eggs
1. Prepare 2 tsp ground ginger
1. Make ready 1 tsp cinnamon
1. Take 1 tsp nutmeg


If you add too much sugar to the gingerbread mixture and then add icing, you&#39;re double-handling and they&#39;ll be quite sickly. Crisp gingerbread cookies have their place, of course, but sometimes, you want to soften them up a little bit, don&#39;t you? These tender cookies are the perfect fix for that craving, combining the classic spice flavors we all love and a chewy crumb that just about melts in your mouth. Combine the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well.
