##### The ingredients needed to make Gingerbread cookies:

1. Make ready 3 cup all purpose flour
1. Take 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1. Get 3/4 tsp baking soda
1. Make ready 1/4 tsp salt
1. Get 1 tbsp ground ginger

The sweetness of the icing will give you that sugary kick. If you add too much sugar to the gingerbread mixture and then add icing, you&#39;re double-handling and they&#39;ll be quite sickly. Crisp gingerbread cookies have their place, of course, but sometimes, you want to soften them up a little bit, don&#39;t you? These tender cookies are the perfect fix for that craving, combining the classic spice flavors we all love and a chewy crumb that just about melts in your mouth.
