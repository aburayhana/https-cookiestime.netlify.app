- "Add dry ingredients that you&#39;ve already combined together and fold them in using a spatula."
- "Dough will look like it won&#39;t come together but trust me it will. When do looks like that you&#39;ll have to go in there with your hand and combine it gently until it forms a dough, which is very easy and should take no more than 3 minutes."
