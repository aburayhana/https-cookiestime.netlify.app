##### The ingredients needed to make Nora-San&#39;s Soft Peanut Butter Cookies:

1. Take  &#34;Wet&#34; Ingredients
1. Make ready 1 large Egg
1. Prepare 1/4 tsp Apple cider vinegar (just to polish up the recipe and makes baking soda taste lighter; you won&#39;t taste it. )
1. Get 1 tsp Vanilla extract
1. Prepare  For the &#34;Dry&#34; Ingredients

They come out kind of grainy and dry (as I learned the hard way). So, for this recipe, I recommend something like Jif or Skippy. Either creamy or crunchy style will do, as to your preference for chunks or no chunks. I use marijuana-infused butter to medicate this.

Either creamy or crunchy style will do, as to your preference for chunks or no chunks. I use marijuana-infused butter to medicate this.

Next, Add Baking Soda, Baking Powder, and Vanilla Extract.
