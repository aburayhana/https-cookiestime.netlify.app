recipeingredient:
- "150 grams Cake flour soft flour"
- "50 grams Refined white sugar"
- "25 grams Almond flour"
- "10 grams Regular Ground Coffee Beans"
- "60 grams Vegetable oil such as canola oil"
- "1 few drops Maple oil or vanilla oil optional"
- "2 to 3 tablespoons Powdered sugar for decoration"
- "1 Cinnamon powder for decoration optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sift the cake flour and sugar into a bowl. Add the almond flour and mix thoroughly with a whisk so there are no lumps. Add the ground coffee and continue mixing."
- "Add vegetable oil and maple oil (or vanilla oil) to taste. Cut in and blend with your hand until it&#39;s no longer floury. Please do not knead the dough. The dough is done Preheat the oven to 160℃ (325℉)."
- "Divide the dough into 25-28 balls and arrange on a baking pan lined with parchment paper. Leave some space between each ball. Bake for 17 to 18 minutes in the preheated oven. Please keep an eye on them since the baking time may differ depending on the oven."
- "The balls are very delicate when fresh out of the oven and are prone to crumbling when touched, so after taking them out of the oven, let them cool completely without removing them from the baking pan. Once they are completely cool, coat with powdered sugar in a plastic bag and it&#39;s done. It&#39;s super easy and will be done in no time."
- "It&#39;s also delicious if you sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon powder."
- "I tried baking these cookies using instant coffee. They turned out to be more bitter than those made using ground coffee beans. If you think aroma is more important, you may prefer the beans. If you prefer just a little bit of bitterness, please use instant coffee In that case, I recommend using less amount compared to the beans."
- "Here is an additional tip regarding vegetable oil. The surface of the cookies will be more resilient and result in a little lighter texture when ready if you use canola or coconut oil. I recommend it."
