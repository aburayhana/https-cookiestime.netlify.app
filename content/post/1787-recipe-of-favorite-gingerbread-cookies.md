That&#39;s why it&#39;s called gingerbread, not gingercookie. The sweetness of the icing will give you that sugary kick. If you add too much sugar to the gingerbread mixture and then add icing, you&#39;re double-handling and they&#39;ll be quite sickly. Crisp gingerbread cookies have their place, of course, but sometimes, you want to soften them up a little bit, don&#39;t you?
