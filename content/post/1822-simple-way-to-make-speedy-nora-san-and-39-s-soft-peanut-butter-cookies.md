However, all-natural peanut butter does NOT make the best peanut butter cookies! They come out kind of grainy and dry (as I learned the hard way). So, for this recipe, I recommend something like Jif or Skippy. Either creamy or crunchy style will do, as to your preference for chunks or no chunks. I use marijuana-infused butter to medicate this.
