recipeingredient:
- "1 batch sugar cookies gingerbread cookies or other cutout cookies for icing"
- " border icing"
- "1 cup powdered sugar"
- "1/2 tsp vanilla or other flavoring extract"
- "2 to 2 12 tablespoons milk or water"
- "1 Food coloring optional"
- " flood icing"
- "1 cup powdered sugar"
- "1/2 tsp vanilla or other flavoring extract"
- "2 1/2 to 3 tablespoons milk or water"
- "1 Food coloring optional"
- " Equipment"
- "1 small mixing bowls"
- "1 Mixing utensils"
- "1 Squeeze bottles  1 for the border icing and 1 for each color of flood icing"
- "1 small funnel"
- "1 Parchment paper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Clear some counterspace: Iced cookies need at least 24 hours to dry, so clear a good amount of counterspace or tablespace where you can ice the cookies and leave them undisturbed. Cover the counter with parchment paper."
- "Arrange cookies for icing: Allow fresh-baked cookies to cool completely, then arrange all your cookies over the parchment paper. You might find it helpful to leave a small workspace clear in front of you where you can move each cookie as you’re working on it."
- "Prepare the border icing: Mix together the powdered sugar, vanilla, and 2 tablespoons of milk or water for the border icing using a spoon or a fork. It should be quite thick, and if you drizzle a little from your spoon, the ribbon should hold for a few second before melting back into the icing. This border icing should be just thick enough to pour easily. If desired, add food coloring to this border icing now."
- "Transfer the border icing to a squeeze bottle: Insert the funnel in the mouth of one of the squeeze bottles. Spoon some of the border icing into the funnel and let it drip into the bottle. Since this icing is so thick, it can be difficult to get it to drop into the bottle — you can squeeze the bottle to suction the icing and start it flowing. If it still won’t start flowing, add more milk or water one teaspoon at a time until just barely thin enough to pour (be careful of adding too much or else the border icing will pool instead of maintaining a border). Once flowing, it can still take a few minutes for all the icing to funnel into the bottle. Prepare your flood icing while you wait."
- "Prepare flood icing: Mix together the powdered sugar, vanilla and 2 1/2 tablespoons of milk or water for the flood icing using a fork or a spoon. This icing should still be fairly thick, but it should drizzle easily and a bit of drizzled icing should sink immediately back into the icing. If desired add food coloring to the flood icing now."
- "Transfer the flood icing to a squeeze bottle: Clean your funnel and insert it into a clean squeeze bottle. Pour the border icing into the bottle; this icing should be thin enough to funnel easily into the bottle. If necessary, add milk or water 1 tablespoon at a time until a thin, pourable consistency is reached."
- "Prepare as many batches of flood icing as needed to decorate your cookies."
- "Draw the borders around the cookies with border icing: Begin with the border icing and trace the outline of each cookie with icing. Hold the bottle vertical with the tip of the bottle slightly above the cookie. Squeeze gently and with consistent pressure so the border is the same width all the way around. Think of this border icing like drawing lines with a pen. If desired, you can draw inside the cookie — thicker lines are better than thin lines for separating areas of flooded icing."
- "Allow border icing to dry slightly: The border icing doesn&#39;t need to be completely dry, but the next step (flooding the cookies with icing) works better if the borders are at least dry to the touch. If you draw the borders on all your cookies before moving onto flooding, the first cookies will be dry enough to start flooding once you finish drawing the borders."
- "Flood the interior of the cookie with flood icing: Using a bottle of the flood icing, begin filling the interior of the cookie with icing. Use the nose of the bottle to push the icing into the corners and against edges. Think of this flood icing like using a paintbrush."
- "Allow the cookies to dry: Leave the cookies undisturbed for at least 24 hours to fully dry. Depending on the thickness of your icing and the layers on the cookie, it may take longer. When the cookies are dry, the surface of the cookies will be completely smooth, dry, and resistant to nicks or smudges."
- "Store the dried cookies: Once dry, you can stack the cookies between sheets of parchment paper in an airtight container at room temperature for several weeks."
- "The icing will keep for several days in the squeeze bottles. It’s best to store unused icing in the fridge and let it warm to room temperature before using."
- "•Since the icing keeps well, you can spread your cookie decorating over the course of a day or several days. I often create a station in my kitchen and ice a few cookies at a time over a day or two."
- "To make marbleized icing, flood the entire cookie with icing, then drop dots or draw a squiggle line over the top with a contrasting color. Run a toothpick through the contrast icing to &#34;marbleize.&#34;  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/360412-best-cut-out-sugar-cookies"

Marbleized icing: To make marbleized icing, flood the entire cookie with icing, then drop dots or draw a squiggle line over the top with a contrasting color.


To begin with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can have how to decorate cookies with icing using 17 ingredients and 15 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make How to Decorate Cookies with Icing:

1. Prepare 1 batch sugar cookies, gingerbread cookies, or other cut-out cookies for icing
1. Make ready  border icing
1. Take 1 cup powdered sugar
1. Prepare 1/2 tsp vanilla or other flavoring extract
1. Take 2 to 2 1/2 tablespoons milk or water
1. Make ready 1 Food coloring, optional
1. Take  flood icing

As with the icing hearts, this technique starts with a flooded icing base, a secondary color, and a bit of toothpick magic. Start by piping a series of parallel lines across a flooded cookie, squeezing with constant but gentle pressure so the icing falls in an unbroken string. You can simply spoon this icing onto your cookies and gently spread out with a spoon and be done! I love how the icing dries so you don&#39;t have to worry about frosting getting everywhere.
