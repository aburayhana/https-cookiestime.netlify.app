- "It&#39;s also delicious if you sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon powder."
- "I tried baking these cookies using instant coffee. They turned out to be more bitter than those made using ground coffee beans. If you think aroma is more important, you may prefer the beans. If you prefer just a little bit of bitterness, please use instant coffee In that case, I recommend using less amount compared to the beans."
- "Here is an additional tip regarding vegetable oil. The surface of the cookies will be more resilient and result in a little lighter texture when ready if you use canola or coconut oil. I recommend it."
