recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 300° F. If u have a big oven you should use the middle rack to bake these. If you have a small oven you should use the top rack of your oven..."
- "Melt margarine in microwave, set aside to cool a bit... In a large mixing bowl mix all the coconut with half of the flour (you&#39;ll probably need more later but not at this point) Set this aside..."
- "In another bowl whisk together sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, eggs &amp; melted but cooled a bit margarine until well incorporated..."

Keep testing it after adding flour by adding by tbs onto a saucer &amp; make sure to add it back to the other mix each time..."
- "Now you can drop by tbs onto a cookie sheet &amp; bake until the tops are just starting to get golden in color &amp; the bottoms should be light golden brown... When done pull out of the oven &amp; let sit 4-5 minutes... After sitting carefully remove with a spatula &amp; put on a plate or platter to finish cooling... Put another batch in the oven &amp; repeat until all mix is used up..."
- "At this point you can dust them with powdered sugar &amp; eat them if you&#39;d like... Otherwise put about 1/2 of your bag of chocolate chips in a bowl with your wax then into the microwave on low setting until melted... (I use a paring knife to shave the wax so that it melts better) After the chocolate is melted dip each macaroon into the chocolate &amp; shake off excess... Put back onto plate or platter &amp; into the freezer or fridge so the chocolate sets..."
- "Now you can eat them, share them or store them in airtight containers! I hope you all enjoy them! They are delicious &amp; addicting!!"
