- "Bake for 15 minutes, rotating halfway through. Remove when the outside is darker brown, and the inside is lighter brown. Rest on sheet for 1 minute. Remove parchment sheet with cookies onto counter.. After another minute, move to cooling rack. (For ice cream sandwich cookies, double the vanilla and add 2 tbsp of water just before the cider vinegar.)"
