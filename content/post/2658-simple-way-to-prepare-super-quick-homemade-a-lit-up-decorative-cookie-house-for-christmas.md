recipeingredient:
- "1 double the amount of the recipe Cutout cookie dough"
- "15 Storebought hard candies"
- "50 grams Powdered sugar"
- "1 Storebought candies use ones with colorful wrappers"
- "1 Birthday cake candle"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare your favorite cut-out cookie dough. You can make the dough in advance, and freeze it either in dough form or after cutting out the shapes."
- "Cut the cookie dough out and bake it. Here I started by deciding on the size of the base dough (you could use a plate or box as the base instead)."
- "For reference, my base was about 12 x 24 cm. The base of the house was 9.5 cm, and the height of the house was 12.5 cm and 9.5 cm. I added windows and doors."
- "The tree is formed by putting two pieces together in the middle, but one piece was 6 cm wide at the base and 19.5 cm high. I also cut out some ornament shapes."
- "The dough puffs up a bit when it&#39;s baked, so make your cut-out patterns a bit smaller than you want the final shapes to be. If part of the cookie bakes up bumpy, you can just scrape it smooth with a knife."
- "Put a small mound of crushed candies (about 5 mm pieces) in each of the windows when baking the cookie house walls."
- "Make the icing. Add drops of water to the powdered sugar and mix. The icing should be just thick enough that it doesn&#39;t drip easily, and be glossy."
- "Use the icing as glue and snow to put the house and tree together! I stuck on some candies too. There&#39;s a tiny tiny star on top of the tree."
- "Put a small candle in the central triangle of the tree, and fix it in place with a cut-out cookie ornament."
- "From another angle:"
- "Scatter on whatever candies you have as additional decoration."
- "Maybe the candies look like stained glass too?"
- "Make more cut out cookies with any leftover dough. Use these not just for decoration, but as snacks for the kids."
- "Here is how the cookie house looks during the day."
