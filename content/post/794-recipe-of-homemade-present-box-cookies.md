recipeingredient:
- "1 all Cookie Dough"
- "1 dash bit Chocolate"
- "1 Drages"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make half of the cookie dough chocolate and the other half plain, and chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour to cool. Put a little of the chocolate dough aside for the ribbon later."
- "Flatten the dough into rectangles about 17 x 10 cm and 6-7 mm thick. Cut in half lengthwise."
- "Put one strip of chocolate dough in between the two strips of plain and line them up so the edges are neat. Chill in the refrigerator to harden. Also go ahead and put the extra strip of chocolate dough in the refrigerator."
- "Cut the dough from Step 3 into four even pieces. Then cut three of those pieces in half again."
- "Flatten the remaining strip of chocolate dough so it matches the width of three of the pieces from Step 4. Cut into three strips."
- "Put the chocolate strips from Step 5 in between the mixed strips from Step 4, and work with the dough to form into a square."
- "You now have three pieces with a chocolate cross shape. There wasn&#39;t enough chocolate dough for the cookie dough from earlier... Harden the dough in the refrigerator."
- "Once the dough has hardened, cut into cubes. You can probably get 9-10 cubes from each log."
- "Bake the cookie cubes in the oven for 15 minutes at 170℃ (340°F) and then lower the heat to 160℃ (320°F) for 5 more minutes."
- "They&#39;re done baking. The top should be lightly baked and the bottom should be nice and crispy. They are thick cookies, so make sure they are cooked all the way through."
- "Using leftover chocolate dough from Step 1, cut out squares and use them to make ribbons like in the picture."
- "Bake the ribbons for 8 minutes at 170℃ (338°F). These are really small so be careful not to burn them."
- "Once the ribbons have cooled, use melted chocolate as glue to stick a dragée in the middle of each ribbon. I put yellow dragées on the ribbons."
- "Put chocolate on the present boxes too and stick dragées. I used silver ones. Put three on each side and one on each band of chocolate on the top."
- "Lastly, stick the ribbon on with chocolate. Put the cookies in the refrigerator so they cool."
- "And now you&#39;re done! It&#39;s a lot of work, but they turn out really cute."
