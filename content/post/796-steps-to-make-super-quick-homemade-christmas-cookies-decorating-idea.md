- "300 grams flour"
- "180 grams butter"
- "1 eggs"
- "150 grams sugar"
- "1 tsp baking powder"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "30 grams cocoa"
recipeinstructions:
- "Knead the dough of these ingredients."
- "When the dough has nice texture, make a hole in the middle and add 30g of cocoa. It seems like it&#39;s too much cocoa, but trust me-taste is fantastic! It reminds me of Mulino Bianco cookies! Dough is going to be really dry so take your time to carefully knead the cocoa."
- "When the cocoa dough is ready, wrap it in plastic wrap and put it into fridge for half an hour."
- "*30 min later* The dough now can be removed from the fridge, roll it and cut it with cookie cuters. This part is fun and kids can help with making yummy cookies! :)"
- "Put them on baking paper and bake them in preheated oven on 180ºC for 10-12min. When you remove them from the oven, they should be soft a little bit."
- "It&#39;s optional to make a cookie icing-very easy, effective and delicious recipe for cookie decoration. Mix a half cup of powdered sugar with one tablespoon of milk and some extract-I use vanilla extract. You can add some food colouring,too. If you want to make thin lines, it&#39;s better that icing is densely."
