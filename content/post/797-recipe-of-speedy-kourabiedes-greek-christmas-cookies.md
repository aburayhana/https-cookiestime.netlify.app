recipeingredient:
- "250 g butter made from cows milk cold chopped to small cubes"

- "50 g ground almonds or raw almond flakes grounded"
- "75 g icing sugar"
- "1 tbsp rose water"
- "1/2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 tbsp baking powder"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "420 g allpurpose plain flour"
- " lots of icing sugar for powdering 100150g"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven for 170C. If your almonds are not roasted you can roast them first at 200C and let them aside to cool down. Also if you are using raw almond flakes and you ground them, it a perfect time to prep those too now."
- "In a food processor or using a hand mixer or hand blender mix the icing sugar and the cold butter (butter must be cold all the time and shouldn&#39;t warm up during the prep process!) until the butter breaks a little. 10-15 second."
- "Add ground almond, rose water, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt to the butter and sugar mix and blitz it for another 10-15second. Now add the baking powder and flour and mix it for another 10-15 sec. I used a hand mixer and got a crumbly mixture."
- "Sprinkle the roasted almond flakes to the mixture by crushing them with your hands a little. Mix it well but make sure the butter is not melting. 5-10 second."
- "Roll the dry mix tablespoon by tablespoon into rolls and gently make a small dimple on the top if each little roll. No worries if it cracks a little, more space for icing sugar later. Meanwhile you are preparing the second tray (if you bake them in the same time) pop the first tray of rolls into the fridge, so they don&#39;t warm up."
- "On the 2nd and 4th shelf of the oven bake the cookies for 15-20 mon, depends of your oven. They should have a very faint golden tint. Make sore you don&#39;t overtake them."
- "When they are ready, spray them with rose water and let them cool down. If you try to lift them up now they will break."
- "When they are cool, add plenty of icing sugar to a bowl and roll the cookies in there. Keep them in the icing sugar. Enjoy!"
