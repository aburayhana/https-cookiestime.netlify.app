##### The ingredients needed to make gingerbread cookies:

1. Get 1 cup butter
1. Prepare 1 1/2 cup sugar
1. Prepare 1 egg
1. Get 2 tbsp dark corn syrup
1. Get 1 tbsp molasses

If you add too much sugar to the gingerbread mixture and then add icing, you&#39;re double-handling and they&#39;ll be quite sickly. Crisp gingerbread cookies have their place, of course, but sometimes, you want to soften them up a little bit, don&#39;t you? These tender cookies are the perfect fix for that craving, combining the classic spice flavors we all love and a chewy crumb that just about melts in your mouth. Combine the flour, ginger, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves and salt; gradually add to creamed mixture and mix well.
